  q1_c:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations
    comments: The student correctly identifies that for a small enough gamma, the
      distant reward is heavily discounted, making the optimal policy similar to that
      of a short finite horizon where the distant reward is unreachable. The example
      provided is valid, even if the specific numerical threshold for gamma is not
      precise.
  q1_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations
    comments: The student correctly identifies that the optimal policy for a finite
      horizon MDP is generally non-stationary (or "not fixed"), which is the key reason
      why a stationary infinite-horizon policy cannot always match it.
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct approach but significant error
    comments: The overall approach is correct. However, the response consistently
      uses V(s) inside the summation over s' instead of V(s'). This is a significant
      error as it changes the meaning of the expression being bounded.
  q3_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_c:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 2.5
    rubric_item: '-0.5: Minor error'
    comments: The proof is correct in its structure, but there is a typo in the second-to-last
      line. The right-hand side should be r(s,pi(s)) + gamma * sum(...) V'(s'), not
      r(s,pi(s)) + gamma * sum(...) gamma * V'(s').
  q3_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_e:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Moderate error, or a couple minor errors'
    comments: The proof for both inequalities starts from an incorrect statement (e.g.,
      ||V - V*|| = ||V - BV||). While the correct final result is reached, the derivation
      contains significant logical flaws and errors.
