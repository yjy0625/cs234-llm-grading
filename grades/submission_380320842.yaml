    rubric_item: On the right track but conceptual misunderstanding
    comments: "The student correctly identifies that for a range of H (specifically,\
      \ 4 < H < 7), the optimal policy will involve both buying and selling. However,\
      \ their reasoning for H \u2265 7 is incorrect; the optimal policy in that case\
      \ is to always buy to reach the +100 terminal reward as quickly as possible,\
      \ as the episode ends upon reaching that state."

  q1_c:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Incorrect or not attempted
    comments: The student correctly states that such a pair exists, but the provided
      example of gamma=1 and H=7 is incorrect. The optimal policy for an infinite
      horizon with gamma=1 is to first sell until the inventory is empty and then
      buy, which is different from the optimal policy for H=7 (which is to always
      buy).

    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations

  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct approach but significant error
    comments: The student starts with the correct definitions but makes significant
      algebraic errors in the derivation. Specifically, in step 3, the term p(s'|s,pi(s))
      is not correctly factored, and in step 5, the vector (V-V') is incorrectly factored
      out of the summation.
  q3_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 2.5
    rubric_item: '-0.5: Missing steps or minor error(s) in proof or format'
    comments: The proof is logically correct but could be more explicit. The implication
      in step 3, `|| V - V' || <= gamma || V-V'|| => 1 <= gamma`, implicitly assumes
      `||V - V'|| > 0` as part of the proof by contradiction, but this assumption
      is not stated.
  q3_c:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Right idea but incorrect
    comments: The overall structure of the proof is correct, but the intermediate
      steps are flawed. The core reasoning for why the expectation preserves the inequality
      is missing, and there is a significant notational error, using pi(s') instead
      of pi(s) in the transition probability.
