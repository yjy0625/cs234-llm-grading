    comments: The student correctly answers yes and provides a valid, though different
      from the provided solution, line of reasoning. The student argues that for a
      high discount factor (gamma close to 1), the discounted value of an infinite
      stream of +1 rewards from a buy-sell cycle can exceed the discounted value of
      the single +100 reward, which is a correct analysis.
  q1_c:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations
  q1_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
    comments: The proposed reward function, which includes a penalty for waiting to
      merge, is a valid and reasonable solution to the problem.

    rubric_item: '-1: Concluded |V* - V^pi| without explaining one-sided inequality'
    comments: The proof is correct up to the triangle inequality result. However,
      the final step from the max-norm inequality ||V^pi - V*|| <= C to the one-sided,
      per-state inequality V^pi(s) >= V*(s) - C is stated without justification.
