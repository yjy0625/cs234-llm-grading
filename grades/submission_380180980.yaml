    comments: 'The student correctly identifies the key distinction: the optimal policy
      for an infinite-horizon discounted MDP is stationary, while the optimal policy
      for a finite-horizon MDP is generally non-stationary. This is the core reason
      why a single gamma cannot always match any arbitrary finite-horizon policy.'

    comments: The student provides a valid reward function, `r = -|v - avg(v_i)|`,
      and correctly explains why it would incentivize the car to merge onto the highway.
      The second suggestion of following the speed limit is also a reasonable solution.
  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 1.5
    rubric_item: '-1.5: Correct approach but significant error'
    comments: The student correctly sets up the proof by expanding the definitions.
      However, the crucial step of applying the norm inequality (from line 4 to 5)
      is mathematically incorrect and notationally flawed, even though the final result
      is correct.

    comments: The autonomous vehicle example is a great illustration of a safety-critical
      system where a guaranteed lower bound on performance is crucial.
