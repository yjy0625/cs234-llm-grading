    comments: The student correctly identifies that for a small enough discount factor,
      the immediate rewards from selling are preferred over the heavily discounted
      large future reward. The comparison between the value of a 'buy' policy ($100\gamma^7$)
      and a 'sell' policy ($1+\gamma+\gamma^2$) as $\gamma \to 0$ is sound, despite
      a minor error in the exponent (using 6 instead of 7).
