    rubric_item: Doesn't mention that V is a fixed point of B
    comments: 'The response correctly states that ||BV - V|| = 0 if and only if V
      = V*, but the justification is incomplete. It shows that if V = V*, the norm
      is zero, but it does not show the other direction: that if the norm is zero,
      V must be a fixed point of B and therefore equal to the unique fixed point V*.'

    rubric_item: '-0.5: Only proved one of the two inequalities'
    comments: The proof for the first inequality involving V^pi is complete and correct.
      However, the argument for the second inequality involving V* is only a brief
      sketch and contains the incorrect statement that V* = BV.
