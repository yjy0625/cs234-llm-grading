    comments: The student correctly identifies that for a large enough horizon H,
      it is optimal to first take some 'sell' actions to accumulate small rewards
      before taking 'buy' actions to reach the terminal state and get the large reward.
      The example of H=13 is valid and the reasoning is sound.

    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations
    comments: The student correctly identifies that the answer is no and provides
      a good intuition. The key difference is that a finite horizon policy can be
      non-stationary (the optimal action in a state can change depending on the time
      remaining), while an infinite-horizon discounted policy is stationary. The student's
      explanation about the 'cutoff' captures this core difference.
