    comments: The overall logic is correct. However, the notation in the last two
      steps is imprecise. After establishing the inequality in line 3, the expression
      inside the norm is a constant vector, so its max-norm is simply the absolute
      value of that constant, which directly gives the final result.

    comments: The proof is correct and well-explained. There is a minor typo in the
      justification (`V'(s') - V(s') >= 0` instead of `V'(s') - V(s) >= 0`), but the
      mathematical steps and overall logic are flawless.
