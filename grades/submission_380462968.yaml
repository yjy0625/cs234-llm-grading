  q1_c:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct, with explanations'
    comments: The student provides a correct example, although a simpler one like
      gamma=0 and H=1 would also suffice. The reasoning that for a large horizon and
      a high discount factor, the agent will prioritize reaching the large terminal
      reward is sound.
  q1_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 1.5
    rubric_item: '-1.5: Correct approach but significant error'
    comments: The student starts with the correct definitions and the right overall
      approach of bounding the difference for an arbitrary state s. However, the derivation
      contains multiple significant mathematical errors, particularly in handling
      the absolute value of the sum and confusing the max-norm of a vector with the
      value at a single state.
  q3_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-3: Incorrect or did not attempt'
  q3_c:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Doesn't conclude that V = V*
    comments: The response correctly identifies that the condition holds if V is a
      fixed point of B (i.e., V = BV), but it does not state that this fixed point
      is unique and must be the optimal value function V*.
  q3_e:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 4.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Minor error'
    comments: The proof for the second inequality is correct and uses the standard,
      clean approach. The proof for the first inequality, while reaching the correct
      conclusion, contains several notational errors and an incorrect step in reasoning
      about the norm of a sum.
  q3_f:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 4.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Concluded bound without stating pi is greedy w.r.t. V'
    comments: 'The proof correctly uses the triangle inequality but omits the crucial
      first step: stating that since pi is the greedy policy w.r.t. V, we have BV
      = B^pi V. This is required to apply the bound from part (e).'
  q3_g:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
    comments: The student provides an excellent example of a safety-critical system
      (autonomous driving) and correctly explains why a performance bound is useful
      in that context.
  q3_h:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_i:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '-3: Significant error, or several smaller errors'
    comments: The proof is incorrect. The inequality ||V - V* - (V - V^pi)|| <= ||V
      - V*|| is not generally true and represents a fundamental error in applying
      vector norm properties. The proof also fails to use the key assumption that
      V* <= V.
