    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct approach but significant error
    comments: The initial expansion is correct, but the steps involving inequalities
      and norms are not rigorous. The argument incorrectly applies norm properties,
      even though it reaches the correct final result.
  q3_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 2.5
    rubric_item: '-0.5: Missing steps or minor error(s) in proof or format'
    comments: The proof by contradiction is a valid approach and mostly correct. However,
      the final conclusion (that the fixed points must be equal) is not explicitly
      stated, and there is a minor notational error in the setup of the inequality.
