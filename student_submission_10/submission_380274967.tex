\section{Effect of Effective Horizon [8 pts]} 

Consider an agent managing inventory for a store, which is represented as an MDP. The stock level $s$ refers to the number of items currently in stock (between 0 and 10, inclusive). At any time, the agent has two actions: sell (decrease stock by one, if possible) or buy (increase stock by one, if possible).  
\begin{itemize}
\item If $s 
 > 0$ and the agent sells, it receives +1 reward for the sale and the stock level transitions to $s - 1$. If $s = 0$ nothing happens.
 \item If $s < 9$ and the agent buys, it receives no reward and the stock level transitions to $s +  1$.
 \item The owner of the store likes to see a fully stocked inventory at the end of the day, so the agent is rewarded with $+100$ if the stock level ever reaches the maximum level $s = 10$.
 \item $s = 10$ is also a terminal state and the problem ends if it is reached.
\end{itemize}

The reward function, denoted as $r(s, a, s')$, can be summarized concisely as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $r(s,\text{sell}, s-1) = 1$ for $s > 0$ and $r(0,\text{sell},0) = 0$
    \item $r(s, \text{buy}, s+1) = 0$ for $s < 9$ and $r(9, \text{buy}, 10) = 100$. The last condition indicates that transitioning from $s = 9$ to $s = 10$ (fully stocked) yields $+100$ reward.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The stock level is assumed to always start at $s = 3$ at the beginning of the day. We will consider how the agent's optimal policy changes as we adjust the finite horizon $H$ of the problem. Recall that the horizon $H$ refers to a limit on the number of time steps the agent can interact with the MDP before the episode terminates, regardless of whether it has reached a terminal state. We will explore properties of the optimal policy (the policy that achieves highest episode reward) as the horizon $H$ changes.\\

\noindent Consider, for example, $H = 4$. The agent can sell for three steps, transitioning from $s = 3$ to $s = 2$ to $s = 1$ to $s = 0$ receiving rewards $+1$, $+1$, and $+1$ for each sell action. At the fourth step, the inventory is empty so it can sell or buy, receiving no reward regardless. Then the problem terminates since time has expired.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Starting from the initial state $s = 3$, it possible to a choose a value of $H$ that results in the optimal policy taking both buy and sell steps during its execution? Explain why or why not. [2 pts]

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 1(a) %%%%%
    Yes. If given 7 steps, the best policy is to race towards a stock of 10. However, if the agent is given more than 7 steps, every 2 additional steps it is given is an opportunity to gain an additional +1 reward with a buy-sell cycle with the additional time, before making it to 10 stock as late as possible.
    %%%%% End of 1(a) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \newpage

    \item In the infinite-horizon discounted setting, is it possible to choose a fixed value of $\gamma \in [0, 1)$ such that the optimal policy starting from $s = 3$ never fully stocks the inventory? You do not need to propose a specific value, but simply explain your reasoning either way. [2 pts]
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 1(b) %%%%%
    Yes. Since reaching the $s=10$ state is terminal (i.e. the agent will receive no further reward past that point), and the agent is able to indefinitely gain +1 reward every time it buys and sells, it is possible to pick a discount such that the infinite geometric series sum exceeds 100, the next-best possible terminal reward.
    %%%%% End of 1(b) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \newpage

    \item Consider two versions of this inventory MDP. In the first version, the MDP is an \emph{infinite-horizon} MDP with discount factor $\gamma$. In the second version, the MDP is a \emph{finite-horizon} MDP with horizon $H$, no discount factor, and episodes that terminate after exactly $H$ time steps even if a terminal state has not been reached.  

    Does there \textbf{ever} exist a choice of $\gamma$ such that the optimal policy for the infinite-horizon MDP is the same as the optimal policy for the finite-horizon MDP with horizon $H$? If so, give a concrete example of values of $\gamma$ and $H$ for which this holds. [2 pts]
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 1(c) %%%%%
    Yes. We can pick $\gamma=0$ and $H=1$, where our single optimal action is just to sell. A discount of zero creates a hard cutoff after the first step, so the infinite discounted return is just the one reward at the very first step.
    %%%%% End of 1(c) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \newpage

    \item Using the same setup as in part (c), does there \textbf{always} exist a discount factor $\gamma$ such that the optimal policy for the infinite-horizon MDP matches the optimal policy for the finite-horizon MDP for any $H$? Briefly justify your answer in 1--2 sentences.[2 pts]
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 1(d) %%%%%
    No, this isn't generally possible. Since in general in order to match the exact same optimal policy as prescribed by the finite-horizon MDP is decided based on the time remaining (as explained earlier, given some stock $s$ the best action may be either to buy or sell, based solely on how many steps are remaining so as to reach 10 stock as late as possible), and an infinite horizon setting can only approximate this hard cutoff behavior with geometric series, this can't be generally possible. Only in the case of having a discount of zero can we make a true hard cutoff.
    %%%%% End of 1(d) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}

\section{Reward Hacking [5 pts]} 
Q1  illustrates how the particular  horizon and discount factor may lead to 
    to very different policies, even with the same reward and dynamics model. This may lead to unintentional reward hacking, where the resulting policy does not match a human stakeholder's intended outcome. This problem asks you to think about an example where reward hacking may occur, introduced by Pan, Bhatia and Steinhardt\footnote{ICLR 2022 \url{https://openreview.net/pdf?id=JYtwGwIL7ye}}. Consider designing RL for autonomous cars where the goal is to have decision policies that minimize the mean commute for all drivers (those driven by humans and those driven by AI). This reward might be tricky to specify (it depends on the destination of each car, etc) but a simpler reward (called the reward "proxy") is to maximize the mean velocity of all cars. Now consider a scenario where there is a single AI car (the red car in the figure) and many cars driven by humans (the grey car). 

    In this setting, under this simpler "proxy" reward, the optimal policy for the red (AI) car is to park and not merge onto the highway.\footnote{Interestingly, it turns out that systems that use simpler function representations may reward hack less in this example than more complex representations. See Pan, Bhatia and Steinhardt's paper "The Effects of Reward Misspecification: Mapping and Mitigating Misaligned Models" for details.}

    \label{fig:commute}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item  Explain why the optimal policy for the AI car is not to merge onto the highway. [2 pts]

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 2(a) %%%%%
    In this case, there are more gray cars than red cars, which means that whatever greedily benefits the gray cars outweighs the red car overall. So slowing down the incoming traffic at the benefit of one car is less rewarded than just letting the incoming traffic go arbitrarily fast while parking the red car.
    %%%%% End of 2(a) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \newpage
    \item Note this behavior is not aligned with the true reward function. Share some ideas about alternate reward functions (that are not minimizing commute) that might still be easier to optimize, but would not result in the AI car never merging. Your answer should be 2-5 sentences and can include equations: there is not a single answer and reasonable solutions will be given full credit. [3 pts]

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 2(b) %%%%%
    We could have a more-than-linear scaling on a penalty for how long the red car waits to merge, which at some finite time would outpace any reward for having the incoming traffic go fast. Although, arbitrarily large penalties have the chance to cause a problem so ``hard'' that the agent always sees terrible rewards and never finds the solution, so in this case it may be better to additionally provide specific rewards for moving forward without crashing when merging, and bounding the penalty for time waited before merging.

\section{Bellman Residuals and performance bounds [30 pts]}

In this problem, we will study value functions and properties of the Bellman backup operator.
\\

\noindent \textbf{Definitions:} \noindent Recall that a value function is a $|S|$-dimensional vector where $|S|$ is the number of states of the MDP. When we use the term $V$ in these expressions as an ``arbitrary value function'', we mean that $V$ is an arbitrary $|S|$-dimensional vector which need not be aligned with the definition of the MDP at all. 
On the other hand, $V^\pi$ is a value function that is achieved by some policy $\pi$ in the MDP.
For example, say the MDP has 2 states and only negative immediate rewards. $V = [1,1]$ would be a valid choice for $V$ even though this value function can never be achieved by any policy $\pi$, but we can never have a $V^\pi = [1,1]$. This distinction between $V$ and $V^\pi$ is important for this question and more broadly in reinforcement learning.
\\

\noindent \textbf{Properties of Bellman Operators:} In the first part of this problem, we will explore some general and useful properties of the Bellman backup operator, which was introduced during lecture. We know that the Bellman backup operator $B$, defined below is a contraction with the fixed point as $V^*$, the optimal value function of the MDP. The symbols have their usual meanings. $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $0 \leq \gamma < 1$. In all parts, $\|v\| = \max_{s} | v(s) |$ is the infinity norm of the vector.

\begin{equation}
    (BV)(s) = \max_a \left( r(s, a) + \gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,a)V(s') \right)
\end{equation}

\noindent We also saw the contraction operator $B^\pi$ with the fixed point $V^\pi$, which is the Bellman backup operator for a particular policy given below:

\begin{equation}
    (B^\pi V)(s) = r(s,\pi(s)) + \gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))V(s')
\end{equation}


\noindent In this case, we'll assume $\pi$ is deterministic, but it doesn't have to be in general. In class, we showed that $|| BV - BV' || \leq \gamma ||V - V'||$ for two arbitrary value functions $V$ and $V'$. 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Show that the analogous inequality, $|| B^\pi V - B^\pi V' || \leq \gamma ||V - V'||$, also holds. [3 pts].

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 3(a) %%%%%
    Expand the definition of $B^\pi *$;
    
    We want to prove:
    $$||r(s,\pi(s)) + \gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))V(s') - r(s,\pi(s)) - \gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))V'(s')||$$
    Cancel and simplify:
    $$||\gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))(V(s') - V'(s'))||$$
    Since infinity norm is just a max over $|s|$ for arbitrary $s$ we'll substitute in the absolute value operator and now consider a generic $s$:
    $$|\gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))(V(s') - V'(s'))|$$
    The absolute value of a sum is less than or equal to the sum of absolute values, and probabilities are positive, so we can take them out:
    $$|\gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))(V(s') - V'(s'))| \leq \gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))|(V(s') - V'(s'))|$$
    and by the definition of the max norm $||V - V'|| \geq |(V(s') - V'(s'))|$ for any $s'$, so
    $$|\gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))(V(s') - V'(s'))| \leq \gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))||V - V'||$$
    $$\implies |\gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))(V(s') - V'(s'))| \leq \gamma||V - V'||\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))$$
    and probability distributions sum to 1, so
    $$\implies |\gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))(V(s') - V'(s'))| \leq \gamma||V - V'||$$
    Since this is true for arbitrary $s$, it must be true for whichever $s$ maximizes the norm so
    $|| B^\pi V - B^\pi V' || \leq \gamma ||V - V'||$ as required.
    %%%%% End of 3(a) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \newpage
    \item Prove that the fixed point for $B^\pi$ is unique. Recall that the fixed point is defined as $V$ satisfying $V = B^\pi V$. You may assume that a fixed point exists. \textit{Hint:} Consider proof by contradiction. [3 pts].

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 3(b) %%%%%
    Assuming there is a fixed point $V^*$, suppose there is some other fixed point $V^\dagger \neq V^*$.
    From the proof in part a),
    $$|| B^\pi V^* - B^\pi V^\dagger || \leq \gamma ||V^* - V^\dagger||$$
    and since both points are fixed
    $$|| V^* - V^\dagger || \leq \gamma ||V^* - V^\dagger||$$
    which for $\gamma \in [0, 1)$ cannot be true. Thus, there can only be one fixed point.
    %%%%% End of 3(b) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \newpage
    \item Suppose that $V$ and $V'$ are vectors satisfying $V(s) \leq V'(s)$ for all $s$. Show that $B^\pi V(s) \leq B^\pi V'(s)$ for all $s$. Note that all of these inequalities are element-wise. [3 pts].
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 3(c) %%%%%
    Again, consider any arbitrary $s$. We want to show that in general
    $$r(s,\pi(s)) + \gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))V(s') \leq r(s,\pi(s)) + \gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))V'(s')$$ by the definition of the contraction.
    Cancel out like terms:
    $$\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))V(s') \leq \sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,\pi(s))V'(s')$$
    Since $V(x) \leq V'(x)$ for all $x$ this holds for any choice of $s'$
    so in general $p(s'|s,\pi(s))V(s') \leq p(s'|s,\pi(s))V'(s')$
    and therefore the sum over all such $s'$ follows the same inequality.
    %%%%% End of 3(c) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \newpage
\end{enumerate}


\noindent \textbf{Bellman Residuals:} Having gained some intuition for value functions and the Bellman operators, we now turn to understanding how policies can be extracted and what their performance might look like. We can extract a greedy policy $\pi$ from an arbitrary value function $V$ using the equation below. 
\begin{equation}
    \pi(s) = \argmax_{a} [{r(s,a) + \gamma\sum_{s' \in S}p(s'|s,a)V(s')}]
\end{equation}

It is often helpful to know what the performance will be if we extract a greedy policy from an arbitrary value function. To see this, we introduce the notion of a Bellman residual.

Define the Bellman residual to be $(BV - V)$ and the Bellman error magnitude to be $||BV - V||$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(d)] For what value function $V$ does the Bellman error magnitude $\|BV - V \|$ equal 0? Why? [2 pts]

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 3(d) %%%%%
    By construction this fixed value function must be $V^*$, since by the definition of the contraction $BV^* = V^*$ so the maximum error magnitude is zero.
    %%%%% End of 3(d) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \newpage
    \item[(e)] Prove the following statements for an arbitrary value function $V$ and any policy $\pi$.  [5 pts]\\
    \textit{Hint:} Try leveraging the triangle inequality by inserting a zero term.
    \begin{equation}
        ||V - V^\pi|| \leq \frac{||V - B^\pi V||}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        ||V - V^*|| \leq \frac{||V - BV||}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 3(e) %%%%%
    By triangle inequality
    $$||V - V^\pi || = ||V + B^\pi V - B^\pi V - V^\pi|| \leq ||V - B^\pi V|| + ||B^\pi V  - V^\pi||$$
    and
    $$||V - V^* || = ||V + B V - B V - V^*|| \leq ||V - B V|| + ||B V  - V^*||$$
    and under $B^\pi$ we know that $B^\pi V^\pi = V^\pi$ and under $B$ we know that $B V^* = V^*$:
    $$||V - V^\pi || \leq ||V - B^\pi V|| + ||B^\pi V  - B^\pi V^\pi||$$
    and
    $$||V - V^* || \leq ||V - B V|| + ||B V  - BV^*||$$
    By part a) and the result in class, $|| BV - BV' || \leq \gamma ||V - V'||$ and $|| B^\pi V - B^\pi V' || \leq \gamma ||V - V'||$:
    $$||V - V^\pi || \leq ||V - B^\pi V|| + \gamma||V - V^\pi||$$
    and
    $$||V - V^* || \leq ||V - B V|| + \gamma||V - V^*||$$
    rearrange to
    $$(1-\gamma)||V - V^\pi || \leq ||V - B^\pi V||$$
    and
    $$(1-\gamma)||V - V^* || \leq ||V - B V||$$
    so,
    $$||V - V^\pi || \leq \frac{||V - B^\pi V||}{(1-\gamma)}$$
    and
    $$||V - V^* || \leq \frac{||V - B V||}{(1-\gamma)}$$
    , as required.
    %%%%% End of 3(e) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \newpage
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The result you proved in part (e) will be useful in proving a bound on the policy performance in the next few parts. Given the Bellman residual, we will now try to derive a bound on the policy performance, $V^\pi$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(f)] Let $V$ be an arbitrary value function and $\pi$ be the greedy policy extracted from $V$. Let $\epsilon = ||BV-V||$ be the Bellman error magnitude for $V$. Prove the following for any state $s$. [5 pts]\\
    \textit{Hint:} Try to use the results from part (e).
    \begin{equation}
        V^\pi(s) \geq V^*(s) - \frac{2\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 3(f) %%%%%
    We are given
    \begin{equation}
        ||V - V^\pi|| \leq \frac{||V - B^\pi V||}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        ||V - V^*|| \leq \frac{||V - BV||}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}
    The difference between $B$ and $B^\pi$ is that $B$ takes a max over all actions. But $\pi$ is a greedy policy, so actually $B = B^\pi$, so we can substitute in.
    Since the infinity norm is a max over absolute values, the order of subtraction doesn't matter, so we can also substitute $\epsilon$:
    \begin{equation}
        ||V - V^\pi|| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        ||V - V^*|| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}
    We can make a statement about the difference between $V^\pi$ and $V^*$ with triangle inequality:
    \begin{equation}
        ||V^\pi - V^*|| \leq ||V^\pi - V|| + ||V - V^*|| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma} + \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}
    again since order doesn't matter inside the norm. By the definition of the max norm, it follows that for arbitrary $s$,
    \begin{equation}
        V^\pi(s) \geq V^*(s) - \frac{2\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation} (move terms, negate and flip inequality)
    , as required.
    %%%%% End of 3(f) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \newpage
    \item[(g)] Give an example real-world application or domain where having a lower bound on $V^\pi(s)$ would be useful. [2 pt]
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 3(g) %%%%%
    In specific cases where the rewards (and hence the values) represent a specific important value, e.g. dollars, we can interpret a lower bound on the performance as a guarantee of safety, e.g. worst case performance literally cannot be worse than so and so dollars. Safety critical settings can use this.
    %%%%% End of 3(g) %%%%%
    \end{tcolorbox}\newpage

    \item[(h)] Suppose we have another value function $V'$ and extract its greedy policy $\pi'$.  $\|B V' - V' \| = \epsilon = \|B V - V\|$. Does the above lower bound imply that $V^\pi(s) = V^{\pi'}(s)$ at any $s$? [2 pts]
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]

    No. Just because $\epsilon$, which is just the largest single error across all $s$, which establishes some shared lower bound. But at an arbitrary $s$ the particular value can be anywhere greater than the lower bound.

\noindent {A little bit more notation:} define $V \leq V'$ if $\forall s$, $V(s) \leq V'(s)$. 
\\

\noindent What if our algorithm returns a $V$ that satisfies $V^* \leq V$? I.e., it returns a value function that is better than the optimal value function of the MDP. Once again, remember that $V$ can be any vector, not necessarily achievable in the MDP but we would still like to bound the performance of $V^\pi$ where $\pi$ is extracted from said $V$. We will show that if this condition is met, then we can achieve an even tighter bound on policy performance.



\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Using the same notation and setup as part (e), if $V^* \leq V$, show the following holds for any state $s$. [5 pts]\\
    \textit{Hint:} Recall that $\forall \pi$, $V^\pi \leq V^*$. (why?)
    \begin{equation}
        V^\pi(s) \geq V^*(s) - \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}
     where $\epsilon = \|B V - V\|$  (as above) and the policy $\pi$ is the greedy policy induced by $V$. 
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    %%%%% Start of 3(i) %%%%%
    As with part f):
    \begin{equation}
        ||V - V^\pi|| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        ||V - V^*|| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}
    Because $V^\pi < V^*$, $V^\pi < V$ transitively.
    So then the errors in both of the above inequalities are actually both positive with $V^\pi(s) \leq V^*(s) \leq V(s)$ for arbitrary $s$. By construction, since the error $V(s) - V^\pi (s)$ is bounded by $\frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}$, $V^*(s) - V^\pi (s)$ must be bounded by $\frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}$.
    Because we know that $V^* \geq V^\pi$,
    \begin{equation}
        V^\pi(s) \geq V^*(s) - \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
    \end{equation}
    , as required.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Intuition:} A useful way to interpret the results from parts (h) (and (i)) is based on the observation that a constant immediate reward of $r$ at every time-step leads to an overall discounted reward of $r + \gamma r + \gamma^2 r + \ldots = \frac{r}{1-\gamma}$. Thus, the above results say that a state value function $V$ with Bellman error magnitude $\epsilon$ yields a greedy policy whose reward per step (on average), differs from optimal by at most $2\epsilon$. So, if we develop an algorithm that reduces the Bellman residual, we're also able to bound the performance of the policy extracted from the value function outputted by that algorithm, which is very useful!
\\
\newpage
\noindent \textbf{Challenges:} Try to prove the following if you're interested. \textbf{These parts will not be graded.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(j)] It's not easy to show that the condition $V^* \leq V$ holds because we often don't know $V^*$ of the MDP. Show that if $BV \leq V$ then $V^* \leq V$. Note that this sufficient condition is much easier to check and does not require knowledge of $V^*$. \\
    \textit{Hint}: Try to apply induction. What is $\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} B^n V$?

\newpage
\item[(k)] It is possible to make the bounds from parts (f) and (i) tighter. 
Let $V$ be an arbitrary value function and $\pi$ be the greedy policy extracted from $V$. Let $\epsilon = ||BV-V||$ be the Bellman error magnitude for $V$. Prove the following for any state $s$:
\begin{equation}
        V^\pi(s) \geq V^*(s) - \frac{2\gamma\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
\end{equation}
Further, if $V^* \leq V$, prove for any state $s$
\begin{equation}
        V^\pi(s) \geq V^*(s) - \frac{\gamma\epsilon}{1-\gamma}
\end{equation}

\section{RiverSwim MDP [25 pts]}
Now you will implement value iteration and policy iteration for the RiverSwim environment (see picture below\footnote{Figure copied from \href{https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/hash/6a5889bb0190d0211a991f47bb19a777-Abstract.html}{(Osband \& Van Roy, 2013)}.}) of \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000008000767}{(Strehl \& Littman, 2008)}.

    \caption{The RiverSwim MDP where dashed and solid arrows represent transitions for the \textsc{LEFT} and \textsc{RIGHT} actions, respectively. The assignment uses a modified, customizable version of what is shown above where there are three different strengths (\textsc{WEAK}, \textsc{MEDIUM}, or \textsc{STRONG}) of the current (transition probabilities for being pushed back or successfully swimming \textsc{RIGHT}).}
    \label{fig:riverswim}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Setup:} This assignment needs to be completed with Python3 and \texttt{numpy}. 
\\

\noindent \textbf{Submission:} There is a \texttt{Makefile} provided that will help you submit the assignment. Please run \texttt{make clean} followed by \texttt{make submit} in the terminal and submit the resulting zip file on Gradescope.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item \textbf{(coding)} Read through \texttt{vi\_and\_pi.py} and implement \texttt{bellman\_backup}. Return the value associated with a single Bellman backup performed for an input state-action pair. [4 pts]\\


\item \textbf{(coding)} Implement \texttt{policy\_evaluation}, \texttt{policy\_improvement} and \texttt{policy\_iteration} in  \texttt{vi\_and\_pi.py}. Return the optimal value function and the optimal policy. [8pts]\\


\item \textbf{(coding)} Implement \texttt{value\_iteration} in \texttt{vi\_and\_pi.py}. Return the optimal value function and the optimal policy. [8 pts]\\


\item \textbf{(written)} Run both methods on RiverSwim with a \textsc{weak} current strength and find the largest discount factor (\textbf{only} up to two decimal places) such that an optimal agent starting in the initial far-left state (state $s_1$ in Figure \ref{fig:riverswim}) \textbf{does not} swim up the river (that is, does not go \textsc{RIGHT}). Using the value you find, interpret why this behavior makes sense. Now repeat this for RiverSwim with \textsc{medium} and \textsc{strong} currents, respectively. Describe and explain the changes in optimal values and discount factors you obtain both quantitatively and qualitatively. [5 pts]\\ \\
\textit{Sanity Check:} For RiverSwim with a discount factor $\gamma = 0.99$ and a \textsc{weak} current, the values for the left-most and right-most states ($s_1$ and $s_6$ in Figure \ref{fig:riverswim} above) are \texttt{30.328} and \texttt{36.859} when computed with a tolerance of $0.001$. The value functions from VI and PI should be within error tolerance $0.001$ of these values. You can use this to verify your implementation. For grading purposes, we shall test your implementation against other hidden test cases as well.
 
\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
%%%%% Start of 4(d) %%%%%
On weak current, the maximum such $\gamma$ is 0.67. On medium current, it is 0.77. On strong current, it is 0.93. 

As the discount gets smaller, the decay of the reward given at the goal state shrinks much faster and the cost of swimming right, which guarantees at least four steps of zero reward before reaching the goal, is eventually higher than the reward.

As the current gets stronger, the value of the states closer to the left become closer to each other because the transition probability for eventually reaching the reward state is lower. As such, the discount can get quite high before the integral over probable next values exceeds the value of going left.

These two ways of making the swim-right policy more expensive (making it very hard to swim right vs. effectively decreasing the agent's ability to see the future) trade off, so the harder it is to swim, the less ``reward blind'' we need to make the agent.
