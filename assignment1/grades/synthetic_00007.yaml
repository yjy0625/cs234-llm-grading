    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect or not attempted'
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that no such gamma exists. A simple counterexample
      is gamma=0, which makes the infinite-horizon policy myopic and thus equivalent
      to the finite-horizon policy with H=1.
  q1_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect or not attempted'
    comments: The student's answer is incorrect. The fundamental issue is that finite-horizon
      optimal policies can be non-stationary (the best action in a state depends on
      the time remaining), while infinite-horizon discounted optimal policies are
      stationary. A stationary policy cannot always match a non-stationary one.
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t explain or imply that merging would slow down cars
      on the highway'
    comments: The response focuses on the AI car's own velocity, but the reward is
      the mean velocity of *all* cars. The key insight is that merging would slow
      down the other cars, lowering the overall average.
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
    comments: The student provides several valid and well-reasoned alternative reward
      functions. Rewarding progress toward the destination or penalizing waiting are
      both excellent solutions that address the specific reward hacking problem.
  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_c:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t conclude that V = V*'
    comments: The response correctly identifies that V must be a fixed point of B,
      but it doesn't state the final conclusion that V must be the optimal value function,
      V*.
  q3_e:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 5.0
    rubric_item: Only proved one of the two inequalities
    comments: The proof for the bound on ||V - V^pi|| is correct, but the analogous
      proof for the bound on ||V - V*|| was not provided.
  q3_f:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 5.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_g:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_h:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect (answers yes) or blank'
    comments: The student incorrectly concludes that equal Bellman error implies equally
      good policies. The Bellman error only provides an upper bound on the suboptimality
      of the induced greedy policy; two policies with the same upper bound are not
      necessarily equally good.
  q3_i:
    max_points: 5.0
