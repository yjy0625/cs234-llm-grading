    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t conclude that V = V*'
    comments: The response correctly identifies that V must be a fixed point of the
      Bellman operator, but it does not state the final conclusion that V must be
      the unique fixed point, V*.

    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect (answers yes) or blank'
    comments: The student incorrectly answers 'Yes'. Equal Bellman error only guarantees
      that the performance of the induced greedy policies are within the same bound
      of the optimal policy's performance; it does not guarantee that their performances
      are equal.
