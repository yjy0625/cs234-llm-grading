    rubric_item: On the right track but conceptual misunderstanding
    comments: The student correctly identifies the two main strategies (pure sell
      vs. pure buy to reach the goal), but incorrectly concludes that a mix of actions
      can never be optimal. This is a common greedy-style error; for certain horizons
      (e.g., H=5), a buy action can enable more future sell actions, leading to a
      higher total reward than a pure sell strategy.

    comments: The student provides several excellent and well-reasoned alternative
      reward functions. Each one correctly identifies a way to incentivize the AI
      car to merge while still being a reasonable proxy for the true goal.

    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t provide a real-world example where a lower bound is
      useful'
    comments: The response provides a valid application of the Bellman residual bounds
      in general, but it doesn't explain why a lower bound on performance is specifically
      useful, which is key for safety-critical systems where a minimum performance
      guarantee is needed.
