  q1_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: On the right track but conceptual misunderstanding
    comments: The student incorrectly concludes that the optimal policy will never
      involve buying. They fail to consider that after the stock is depleted (s=0),
      buying an item allows for a subsequent sale, which can increase the total reward
      compared to a sell-only strategy for certain horizons (e.g., H=5).
  q1_b:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect or not attempted'
    comments: "The student's conclusion is incorrect. For a small enough discount\
      \ factor (e.g., \n\n\\[\n\\gamma = 0\n\\]\n\n), the agent will prioritize immediate\
      \ rewards. The large future reward of +100 would be discounted to be worth less\
      \ than the immediate +1 reward from selling."
  q1_c:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct, with explanations'
  q1_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t explain or imply that merging would slow down cars
      on the highway'
    comments: The explanation focuses on the AI car's own velocity being lowered by
      merging, but misses the more critical point that merging would also slow down
      the many other cars on the highway, which has a much larger effect on the mean
      velocity.
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
    comments: The student provides several reasonable alternative reward functions.
      For example, rewarding the car for reaching a waypoint on the highway would
      incentivize it to merge, and this is simpler to optimize than the true reward
      of minimizing global commute time.
  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_c:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct

  q3_f:
    max_points: 5.0

    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_g:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
    comments: The student provides a valid real-world application (robotics) and correctly
      explains that the performance bound serves as a safety or sanity check before
      deploying a learned policy.
  q3_h:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect (answers yes) or blank'
    comments: The student incorrectly answers yes. Equal Bellman error only guarantees
      that the value of the induced greedy policies are within the same bound of the
      optimal policy's value; it does not imply they are equal.
