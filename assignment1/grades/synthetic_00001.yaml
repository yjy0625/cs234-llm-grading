    comments: The student's answer is incorrect. For a horizon of H=5, the optimal
      policy from s=3 is to sell three times, then buy once, then sell once, yielding
      a total reward of +4. This policy involves both buying and selling.
  q1_b:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Incorrect or not attempted
    comments: The student incorrectly concludes that the large future reward will
      always be preferred for any gamma > 0. They fail to recognize that for a sufficiently
      small gamma, the agent becomes myopic and will prefer the immediate +1 rewards
      from selling.

    comments: The response correctly identifies that the operator is a contraction
      with factor gamma, but the argument provided is not a valid proof. The relationship
      should be an inequality (<=), not an equality (=).
