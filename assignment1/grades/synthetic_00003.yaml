    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect or not attempted'
    comments: "The student incorrectly claims it's not possible. For a small enough\
      \ discount factor \u03B3 (e.g., \u03B3=0), the agent becomes myopic and will\
      \ prioritize the immediate +1 reward from selling over the heavily discounted\
      \ future +100 reward from buying."
  q1_c:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations
  q1_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct, with explanations'
    comments: 'The student correctly identifies the key difference: finite-horizon
      policies can be non-stationary, while infinite-horizon discounted policies are
      stationary, which is the core reason why a match is not always possible.'
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t explain or imply that merging would slow down cars
      on the highway'
    comments: The response focuses on the AI car's own low velocity during the merge,
      but doesn't mention the more significant effect that the many other cars on
      the highway would also have to slow down.
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
    comments: The student provides multiple valid and well-reasoned alternative reward
      functions that would solve the stated problem.
  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_c:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-3: Missing or incorrect'
    comments: The reasoning provided is incorrect. An operator being a contraction
      does not imply that it is monotone. The proof of monotonicity relies on the
      non-negativity of gamma and the transition probabilities.
  q3_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_e:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 5.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_f:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 5.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_g:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Doesn't provide a real-world example where a lower bound is useful
    comments: The response states the purpose of the bound but does not provide a
      specific real-world application where guaranteeing a minimum performance level
      is critical, such as in healthcare or autonomous systems.
  q3_h:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_i:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 5.0
    rubric_item: Correct
