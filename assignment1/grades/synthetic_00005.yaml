    rubric_item: On the right track but conceptual misunderstanding
    comments: 'The student''s reasoning is incorrect because it only considers two
      strategies: pure selling or buying to reach the terminal state. It fails to
      account for a mixed strategy where buying can enable more selling actions within
      the horizon, leading to a higher total reward (e.g., for H=5, a mixed policy
      yields +4 vs. +3 for pure selling).'
  q1_b:

    rubric_item: Correct
  q1_c:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct, with explanations
  q1_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Incorrect or not attempted
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that such a gamma always exists. The
      core reason this is false is that finite-horizon optimal policies can be non-stationary
      (the best action in a state depends on the time remaining), while infinite-horizon
      discounted optimal policies are stationary.
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t explain or imply that merging would slow down cars
      on the highway'
    comments: The explanation correctly identifies that the other cars can move quickly
      if the AI car doesn't merge. However, the reason given for why merging is bad
      focuses on the AI car's own speed, not the more critical fact that its merge
      would force many other cars to slow down.
