  q1_a:

    rubric_item: Correct or close enough
  q1_b:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Incorrect or not attempted
    comments: "The student's reasoning is incorrect. It fails to account for the effect\
      \ of the discount factor, \u03B3. If \u03B3 is sufficiently small (e.g., \u03B3\
      =0), the agent becomes myopic and will prefer the immediate +1 reward from selling\
      \ over the heavily discounted future reward of +100."
  q1_c:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct, but no specific example of gamma given that works
    comments: The student correctly identifies that a myopic policy (where only the
      immediate reward matters) can be equivalent in both settings, but does not provide
      a specific example of gamma and H as requested (e.g., gamma=0 and H=1).
  q1_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct, with explanations'
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t explain or imply that merging would slow down cars
      on the highway'
    comments: The explanation focuses on the AI car's own velocity. The key insight
      is that merging would slow down the many other cars on the highway, thus lowering
      the *mean* velocity of *all* cars.
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 2.5
    rubric_item: '-0.5: Missing steps or minor error(s) in proof or format'
    comments: The student correctly identifies that the uniqueness of the fixed point
      follows from the contraction property of the operator. However, the response
      provides an intuitive explanation rather than a formal proof with the necessary
      mathematical steps and inequalities.
  q3_c:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t conclude that V = V*'
    comments: The response correctly identifies that V must be a fixed point of B,
      but it doesn't take the final step to conclude that V must be the unique fixed
      point, V*.
  q3_e:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 5.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_f:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 4.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Concluded |V* - V^pi| without explaining one-sided inequality'
    comments: The response correctly identifies the key steps but does not justify
      the conversion from the infinity norm bound to the one-sided inequality, which
      relies on the fact that V* >= V^pi.
  q3_g:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_h:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: Correct
  q3_i:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-5: Incorrect or blank'
    comments: The student did not provide a proof, stating they did not know how to
      solve the problem.
