  q1_a:

    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: On the right track but conceptual misunderstanding'
    comments: The student's reasoning is partially correct, but they fail to consider
      cases where a combination of buy and sell actions can lead to a higher reward
      within the given horizon. They correctly identify that immediate rewards are
      obtained from selling and that reaching s=10 requires multiple buy actions.
      However, they incorrectly conclude that mixing buy and sell actions always wastes
      steps.
  q1_b:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect or not attempted'
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that for any gamma > 0, the agent will
      eventually prefer to buy up to s=10. This is not true for all gamma > 0. For
      example, if gamma is close to 0, the agent will prefer to sell.

  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 1.5
    rubric_item: '-1.5: Correct approach but significant error'
    comments: The student correctly identifies the linear relationship and the contraction
      property but does not provide sufficient justification for the equality. The
      reasoning about transition probabilities summing to 1 is relevant but not fully
      explained to justify the removal of the expectation.

  q3_g:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t provide a real-world example where a lower bound is
      useful'
    comments: The response describes a scenario where an upper bound on error is useful,
      not a lower bound.
