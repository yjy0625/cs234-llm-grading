    comments: The student incorrectly claims that the optimal policy for any finite
      H should just be to sell until s=0. This is not true for all H. For example,
      when H=5, the optimal policy is to sell three times, buy once, and then sell
      again.

    rubric_item: '-1: On the right track but conceptual misunderstanding'
    comments: The student's reasoning is not entirely correct. While a small gamma
      can prioritize earlier rewards, it doesn't perfectly simulate a finite horizon
      because the infinite horizon policy is always stationary, whereas the finite
      horizon policy can be non-stationary.
