    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t mention that V is a fixed point of B'
    comments: The response states that ||BV - V|| = 0 when V = V^*, but it doesn't
      explicitly state that this means V is a fixed point of B. It also doesn't prove
      the reverse direction.

    rubric_item: '-1: Concluded bound without stating pi is greedy w.r.t. V'
    comments: The proof is correct and well-structured, but it does not explicitly
      state that pi is greedy with respect to V at the beginning. This is a crucial
      assumption for the proof to hold.
  q3_g:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t provide a real-world example where a lower bound is
      useful'
    comments: The response provides an application area (autonomous driving) but doesn't
      explain how a lower bound on the value function would be useful in that context.
      It needs to connect the lower bound to a specific decision or action.
