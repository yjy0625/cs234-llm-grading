    comments: The student incorrectly claims that mixing buy and sell actions is never
      optimal. The correct answer is that it is possible to choose a value of H that
      results in the optimal policy taking both buy and sell steps during its execution.

    comments: The response describes a general application of performance bounds but
      does not specifically address the utility of *lower* bounds, which is the focus
      of the question.
