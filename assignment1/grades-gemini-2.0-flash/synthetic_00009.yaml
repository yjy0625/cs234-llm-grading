  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 1.5
    rubric_item: '-1.5: Correct approach but significant error'
    comments: The student has the right intuition but does not provide a rigorous
      proof. They need to use the definition of the Bellman operator and the norm
      to show the inequality.
  q3_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 2.5
    rubric_item: '-0.5: Missing steps or minor error(s) in proof or format'
    comments: The response lacks the explicit use of the contraction mapping property
      to show uniqueness. It needs to show ||V - V'|| = ||B^pi V - B^pi V'|| <= gamma
      ||V - V'|| and then conclude V = V' because gamma < 1.
  q3_c:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 1.5
    rubric_item: '-1.5: Right idea but incorrect'
    comments: The response correctly identifies that the expectation preserves the
      inequality, but incorrectly claims that the reward term could break monotonicity
      if rewards are negative. The reward term is the same in both B^pi V and B^pi
      V', so it does not affect the monotonicity.
  q3_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t conclude that V = V*'
    comments: The student correctly states that V is a fixed point of B, but fails
      to conclude that V = V*.
  q3_e:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 5.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_f:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 5.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_g:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect or no attempt'
  q3_h:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect (answers yes) or blank'
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that equal Bellman error implies equal
      performance of the greedy policies. Equal Bellman error only guarantees that
      both policies are within a bound of optimal, not that they are equal.
