  q1_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect or not attempted'
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that the agent cannot take both buy and
      sell actions in an optimal policy. The student misunderstands that the agent
      can take buy and sell actions at different time steps.
  q1_b:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect or not attempted'
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that the agent will always fully stock
      the inventory. The agent may prioritize shorter term rewards if gamma is low
      enough.
  q1_c:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect or not attempted'
  q1_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: On the right track but conceptual misunderstanding'
    comments: The student is on the right track by considering \(\gamma = 0\), but
      this is only equivalent to H=1, not any finite horizon H.
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t explain or imply that merging would slow down cars
      on the highway'
    comments: The student's response does not explain why the optimal policy for the
      AI car is to not merge onto the highway in terms of maximizing the mean velocity
      of all cars. It doesn't mention that merging would slow down the other cars,
      thus lowering the mean velocity.
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Car still may not merge'
    comments: The proposed solutions may incentivize movement, but do not guarantee
      merging onto the highway, especially if other actions yield higher rewards.
