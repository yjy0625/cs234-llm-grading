    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t conclude that V = V*'
    comments: The student correctly states that ||BV - V|| = 0 implies BV = V, meaning
      V is a fixed point of B. However, they do not conclude that this implies V =
      V*, the unique fixed point of B.

    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect (answers yes) or blank'
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that equal Bellman error implies equally
      good approximations and the same greedy policy. Equal Bellman error only guarantees
      that both policies are within a bound of optimal, not that they are equal.
