  q1_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct or close enough'
  q1_b:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect or not attempted'
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that the +100 reward will always dominate,
      regardless of gamma. When gamma is close to 0, the agent will prioritize immediate
      rewards.
  q1_c:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Correct, but no specific example of gamma given that works'
    comments: The answer is correct, but it does not provide a specific example of
      gamma and H that would make the two MDPs equivalent.
  q1_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct, with explanations'
  q2_a:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t explain or imply that merging would slow down cars
      on the highway'
    comments: The student response focuses on the AI car's speed, not the mean velocity
      of all cars. It doesn't explain that the AI car staying off the highway allows
      the other cars to maintain a higher speed, thus increasing the mean velocity.
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_a:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_c:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 3.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t conclude that V = V*'
    comments: The student correctly states that ||BV - V|| = 0 iff BV = V, meaning
      V is a fixed point of B. However, they fail to conclude that V = V*, which is
      the unique fixed point of B.
  q3_e:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 5.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_f:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 4.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Concluded |V* - V^pi| without explaining one-sided inequality'
    comments: The student correctly identifies the key steps and the final bound but
      expresses uncertainty about the one-sided inequality, which is crucial for the
      final conclusion.
  q3_g:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_h:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '0: Correct'
  q3_i:
    max_points: 5.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-5: Incorrect or blank'
    comments: The student admits they do not know how to prove the tighter bound.
