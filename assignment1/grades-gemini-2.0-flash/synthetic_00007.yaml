    comments: The student incorrectly claims that a \(\gamma\) can always be found
      such that the discounted infinite-horizon optimal policy matches the finite-horizon
      one. The optimal policy for a finite horizon MDP may be non-stationary, while
      the optimal policy for the \(\gamma\)-discounted infinite horizon MDP is always
      stationary.

    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t explain or imply that merging would slow down cars
      on the highway'
    comments: The response does not explicitly state that merging would slow down
      the other cars on the highway, which is key to understanding why the proxy reward
      is not aligned with the true reward.
  q2_b:
    max_points: 3.0
    points_awarded: 2.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Car still may not merge'
    comments: The student suggests several reward functions, but some of them (like
      penalizing hard braking/acceleration) might still lead to the AI car not merging
      if merging requires such actions. The reward based on progress toward the destination
      is better, but the student does not specify how to deal with the cars destination.

  q3_d:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 1.0
    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t conclude that V = V*'
    comments: The student correctly states that ||BV - V|| = 0 when BV = V, but fails
      to conclude that this implies V = V*.

  q3_h:
    max_points: 2.0
    points_awarded: 0.0
    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect (answers yes) or blank'
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that equal Bellman error implies equally
      good value functions and policies.
