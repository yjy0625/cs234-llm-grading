    comments: The student's response suggests that a small \(\gamma\) can always make
      the infinite horizon policy match the finite horizon policy. However, the core
      issue is that finite horizon policies can be non-stationary, while infinite
      horizon policies are stationary. This difference cannot be overcome by simply
      adjusting \(\gamma\).

    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t provide a real-world example where a lower bound is
      useful'
    comments: The student provides an application of the performance bound for the
      greedy policy, but does not give a real-world application of the lower bound.

    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect (answers yes) or blank'
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that equal Bellman error implies comparable
      performance. Equal Bellman error only guarantees that both policies are within
      a bound of optimal, not that they are equal.
