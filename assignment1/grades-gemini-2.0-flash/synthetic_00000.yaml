    rubric_item: '-1: Car still may not merge'
    comments: The student suggests rewarding the AI car for being on the highway and
      moving forward, but this might still lead to the car finding other ways to maximize
      the reward without actually merging properly. The car could drive very slowly
      on the on-ramp.

    rubric_item: '-1: Doesn''t provide a real-world example where a lower bound is
      useful'
    comments: The response describes a general application of performance bounds but
      does not specifically address a real-world application where a *lower bound*
      on performance is particularly important. The example given is more about ensuring
      the policy isn't too far from optimal, rather than guaranteeing a minimum level
      of performance.
  q3_h:

    rubric_item: '-2: Incorrect (answers yes) or blank'
    comments: The student incorrectly claims that equal Bellman error implies equally
      good greedy policies.
